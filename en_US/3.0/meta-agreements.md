# The Organic Organization Meta-Agreements

Organic Organization (O2) is a catalyst that helps organizations adopt self-management. O2 is composed of its Meta-Agreements described in this document, in addition to an ever evolving [Pattern Library][library].

## <span id="meta-agreements">Meta-Agreements</span>

A "Meta-Agreement" is an agreement for the formation of new agreements. In this document, the initial Meta-Agreements of the Organic Organization are described, each identified by a title and a description. The Meta-Agreements are hyperlinked to each other to demonstrate their interdependence.

## <span id="adoption">Adoption</span>
This document does not define how the [Meta-Agreements](#meta-agreements) are adopted, how they can be modified or what the [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose) of the [Organization](#organization) is. This is usually established through a social contract, corporate by-laws or agreements between a group of people that created the organizational entity.

## <span id="organization">1. Organization</span></span>

An "Organization" is an entity created to express an [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionar-purpose). An Organization has assets that it controls and a clear boundary with the outside world.

### <span id="evolutionary-purpose">1.1 Evolutionary Purpose</span>
An [Organization](#organization) has an "Evolutionary Purpose", which corresponds to the *deepest creative potential it can sustainably express in the world*. The Evolutionary Purpose is the [Purpose](#roles) of the broadest [Circle][#circles] in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure).

### <span id="partners">1.2 Partners</span>
The [Organization](#organization) can have one or more "Partners", who are people that fill [Roles](#roles) and express the [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose).

### <span id="tensions">1.3 Tensions</span>
When pursuing the [Purpose](#roles) of one or more [Roles](#roles), [Partners](#partners) can identify a difference between the current reality and the potential they sense. These gaps, which may be issues or opportunities identified, are called "Creative Tensions", or simply "Tensions". Tensions move the [Organization](#organization) towards its [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose).

## <span id="organizational-structure">2. Organizational Structure</span>

[Partners](#partners) may govern and define a layer of agreements that establishes expectations and limitations of authority between them. This layer, called "Organizational Structure", is organized in a hierarchy of [Circles](#circles) and consists of [Roles](#roles) and [Restrictions](#restrictions). Each [Circle](#circles) governs its own Organizational Structure, which can only be changed in the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode) of its [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting).

### <span id="roles">2.1 Roles</span>
[Partners](#partners) perform the work in one or more explicitly defined "Roles" in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure). A Role is defined by:

- A descriptive name;
- A "Purpose", which is a capacity, potential or unreachable goal that the Role will pursue or express;
- Zero or more "Accountabilities", which are ongoing activities other [Partners](#partners) can expect the Role will perform;
- Zero or more "Artifacts", which are assets the Role can exclusively control and regulate on behalf of the [Organization](#organization).

### <span id="circles">2.2 Circles</span>
A "Circle" is a [Role](#roles) that has the authority to break itself down in smaller [Roles](#roles), contained within itself. When a [Role](#roles) is transformed into a Circle, the [Partners](#partners) who filled it become the [Outer Link](#outer-link) of that [Circle](#circle). [Circles](#circles) are defined exactly as [Roles](#roles), that is, through the elements name, [Purpose](#roles), [Accountabilities](#roles), and [Artifacts](#roles).

#### <span id="circles-cannot-modify-their-definition">2.2.1 Circles cannot modify their definition</span>
A [Circle](#circles) may govern its own [Roles](#roles) and [Restrictions](#restrictions), but it cannot modify its own definition, because that should be made in the outer [Circle](#circle) which contains it.

#### <span id="circulos-cannot-structure-their-inner-circles">2.2.2 Circles cannot structure their inner Circles</span>

A [Circle](#circles) cannot modify the [Roles](#roles), [Circles](#circles) and [Restrictions](#restrictions) of an inner [Circle](#circles) directly. However, a [Circle](#circles) can perform some operations in its [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode), like moving [Roles](#roles) from itself to one of its inner [Circles](#circles) and vice versa.

### <span id="circle-artifacts">2.3 Circle Artifacts</span>
When a [Circle](#circles) has [Artifacts](#roles) in its definition, only [Circle Members](#circle-members) may impact these [Artifacts](#roles) without violating the [Duty of preservation](#duty-of-preservation).

#### <span id="circles-can-delegate-artifacts">2.3.1 Circles can delegate Artifacts</span>
Through its [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode), a [Circle](#circles) may specify one of its [Artifacts](#roles) in a [Role](#roles) or inner [Circle](#circles). If that is the case, that [Artifact](#roles) becomes exclusive to the [Role](#roles) or inner [Circle](#circles).

### <span id="circle-members">2.4 Circle Members</span>
[Partners](#partners) are considered "Members" of a given [Circle](#circles) when they meet at least one of the criteria below:

- Fill at least one [Role](#roles) defined in the [Circle](#circles);
- Fill at least one of the [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) in the [Circle](#circles);
- Fill the [Outer Link](#outer-link) [Role](#roles) or the [Inner Link](#inner-link) [Role](#roles) in at least one of the inner [Circles](#circles).

### <span id="restrictions">2.5 Restrictions</span>

"Restrictions" are limitations of authority that apply to all [Roles](#roles) of a [Circle](#circles). Restrictions are composed of a name and a description. Unless otherwise specified in their definition, the effect of a Restriction applies to all [Roles](#roles) and inner [Circles](#circles) from where it is defined. A Restriction is part of a [Circle](#circles), as well as a [Role](#roles) or an inner [Circle](#circles).

#### <span id="restrictions-cannot-establish-expectations">2.5.1 Restrictions cannot establish expectations</span>

[Restrictions](#restrictions) cannot establish expectations, because that is the goal of an [Accountability](#roles). Nevertheless, a [Restriction](#restrictions) can demmand action, but only for the [Partners](#partners) on which the [Restriction](#restrictions) applies and in the specific condition that triggers it.

## <span id="rights-and-duties">3. Rights and Duties</span>
All [Partners](#partners) may enjoy the "Rights" presented below, but also are bound by their "Duties".

### <span id="right-to-refuse-requests">3.1 Right to refuse requests</span>
[Partners](#partners) may refuse requests, if there is no explicit corresponding [Accountability](#roles) in the description of the [Role](#roles) being requested. However, [Partners](#partners) must always accept requests that make sense to the [Purpose](#roles) of one of their [Roles](#roles), even if no explicit [Accountability](#roles) is recorded.

### <span id="right-to-act-for-the-purpose">3.2 Right to act for the Purpose</span>
When pursuing the [Purpose](#roles) of their [Roles](#roles), [Partners](#partners) are always authorized to take action, unless the [Duty of Preservation](#duty-of-preservation) restricts them.

### <span id="right-to-act-heroically">3.3 Right to act heroically</span>
[Partners](#partners) may temporarily ignore these [Meta-Agreements](#meta-agreements) if this is useful and necessary for expressing the [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose) of the [Organization](#organization). Initiatives or requests that have this quality are called "Heroic Acts". [Partners](#partners) must seek to repair any damage caused after a Heroic Act, by proposing changes to the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) or even to these [Meta-Agreements](#meta-agreements) if necessary.

### <span id="right-to-leave-roles">3.4 Right to leave Roles</span>
[Partners](#partners) may any time leave [Roles](#roles) they fill in one or more [Circles](#circles), unless they otherwise agreed with the [Outer Link](#outer-link) or any process that assigns [Partners](#partners) to [Roles](#roles).

### <span id="duty-of-expression">3.5 Duty of expression</span>
Each [Partner](#partners) is responsible for identifying one's [Tensions](#tensions) through each [Role](#roles) one fills. Each [Partner](#partners) is also responsible for trying to solve those [Tensions](#tensions), engaging other [Partners](#partners) in their [Duties](#rights-and-duties) or by proposing changes to the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure).

### <span id="duty-of-transparency">3.6 Duty of transparency</span>
When requested, it is expected that [Partners](#partners) share any relevant information about their [Role](#roles)'s work, including each project they are working on, actions identified, prioritization criteria and relevant metrics. When requested, it is also expected that [Partners](#partners) provide estimates and projections of possible conclusion dates of their work, even though those projections shall not be considered deadlines or committments.

### <span id="duty-of-prioritization">3.7 Duty of prioritization</span>
[Partners](#partners) must prioritize their work in alignment with [Circle](#circles) priorities defined by the [Outer Link](#outer-link), or by any other process that establishes priorities for the [Circle](#circle).

### <span id="duty-of-attendance">3.8 Duty of attendance</span>
When requested, [Partners](#partners) must prioritize attending to the [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) even over working on their [Roles](#roles).

### <span id="duty-of-preservation">3.9 Duty of preservation</span>
[Partners](#partners) through the [Roles](#roles) they fill must not impact the [Artifacts](#roles) of other [Roles](#roles) contained in the same [Circle](#circles), without before obtaining an explicit permission from the [Partner](#partners) that fills the corresponding [Role](#roles). [Partners](#partners) also must note the [Restrictions](#restrictions) defined in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) and follow the conditions set out therein.

## <span id="circle-meetings">4. Circle Meetings</span>

[Circle Members](#circle-members) gather regularly in a space called "Circle Meeting" to perform one or more of the 5 special "Modes" described in the upcoming section: [Review](#review-mode), [Sync](#sync-mode), [Adapt](#adapt-mode), [Select](#select-mode), and [Care](#care-mode). Circle Meetings are scheduled by the [Secretary](#secretary) and facilitated by the [Facilitator](#facilitator), two [Essential Roles](#essential-roles).

### <span id="only-members-can-process-tensions">4.1 Only Members can process Tensions</span>

[Partners](#partners) that are not [Circle Members](#circle-members) cannot process [Tensions](#tensions) in [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings), unless they are invited by a [Circle Member](#circle-members) to help in the processing of a specific [Tension](#tensions).

### <span id="meeting-format">4.2 Meeting Format</span>

[Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) should start with a check-in round, where one at a time, each participant shares how one is coming to the meeting. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) then fills the meeting with one or more of the 5 [Modes](#circle-meetings), according to the time available and the needs of the [Circle](#circles). The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must declare the name, goal, and clarify the rules of each [Mode](#circle-meetings) before starting it. [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) end with a closing round, where one at a time, each participant shares a final reflection about the meeting.

#### <span id="tension-list">4.2.1 Tension List</span>

The different [Modes](#circle-meetings) are used to process specific [Tensions](#tensions) felt by the participants. Specially before [Sync](#sync-mode) and [Adapt](#adapt-mode), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must ask the [Secretary](#secretary) to build a "Tension List" to process. Each participant feeling a [Tension](#tensions) must name it using two or three words. The [Secretary](#secretary) then captures the name of the [Tension](#tensions), along with the name of the participant.

#### <span id="one-tension-at-a-time">4.2.2 One Tension at a time</span>

After the [Tension](#tensions) List is built, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must focus in one [Tension](#tension) at a time. This means the [Facilitator](#facilitator) should not allow other participants to try to include their perspectives in the [Tension](#tension) being processed, unless the participant who originally felt the [Tension](#tension) believes that perspective is useful.

### <span id="facilitation-restrictions">4.3 Facilitation Restrictions</span>

During the facilitation of each [Mode](#circle-meetings), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) can make choices about which patterns to use and how to facilitate each moment. However, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must always keep one's choices aligned with the goal of each [Mode](#circle-meetings) and the necessities of the [Circle](#circles). A [Circle](#circles) may also adopt one or more [Restrictions](#restrictions) that further limit how each [Mode](#cicle-meetings) is facilitated. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must respect those limitations.

### <span id="review-mode">4.4 Review Mode</span>

The "Review Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meetings) whose goal is to *give transparency about the work performed by the [Circle](#circles)*. It is up to the [Facilitator](#facilitator) to decide specifically how the Review Mode is facilitated, unless a [Restriction](#restrictions) determines otherwise.

> Check the **Patterns for Reviewing** in the [Pattern Library][library].

### <span id="sync-mode">4.5 Sync Mode</span>

The "Sync Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meetings) whose goal is to *quickly process [Tensions](#tensions) that do not require the [Circle](#circles) to update its [Organizational Structure]*. Typical outputs of the Sync Mode include actions, projects, help requests and information sharing. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must simply allow each participant who brought a [Tension](#tensions) to engage others in their [Roles](#roles) and [Duties](#rights-and-duties), until a path for solving the [Tension](#tensions) is identified. The [Secretary](#secretary) must record any requests accepted by other participants in their [Roles](#roles), or as [Heroic Acts](#right-to-act-heroically).

> Check the **Patterns for Synchronizing** in the [Pattern Library][library].

### <span id="adapt-mode">4.6 Adapt Mode</span>

The "Adapt Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting) whose goal is to *process [Tensions](#tensions) into changes to the [Circle](#circles) [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure)*. The only valid and allowed outputs in Adapt Mode are:

- Adding, removing or modifying [Roles](#roles) of the [Circle](#circles);
- Adding, removing or modifying inner [Circles](#circles);
- Adding, removing or modifying [Restrictions](#restrictions) of the [Circle](#circles);
- Moving its [Roles](#roles), [Restrictions](#restrictions) or inner [Circles](#circles) to an inner [Circle](#circles);
- Moving [Roles](#roles), [Restrictions](#restrictions) or inner [Circles](#circles) of an inner [Circle](#circles) to itself;
- Transforming one of its [Roles](#roles) in an inner [Circles](#circles), and vice versa.

#### <span id="proposal">4.6.1 Proposal</span>

During the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must facilitate a process that allows the participant who brought the [Tension](#tensions), the "Proponent", to craft a "Proposal" for solving it. This Proposal must contain only the operations described as valid outputs for the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode).

#### <span id="examples">4.6.2 Examples</span>

The [Proponent](#proposal) of change to the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) must be able to present examples of past or present situations where each part of the crafted [Proposal](#proposal) would solve or reduce the [Tension](#tensions). If the [Facilitator](#facilitator) considers the [Proponent](#proposal) was not able to present the required examples and clarifications, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must discard the [Proposal](#proposal). However, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with logical reasoning and are thus reasonable.

#### <span id="objections">4.6.3 Objections</span>

The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must give each participant the opportunity to raise one or more "Objections" to the [Proposal](#proposal) presented. An Objection is a reason the [Proposal](#proposal) would cause harm and move the [Circle](#circles) backwards. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) may ask questions to help the "Objector" understand whether what one brought are "Valid Objections" or not.

#### <span id="valid-objections">4.6.4 Valid Objections</span>

An [Objection](#objections) to a [Proposal](#proposal) that seeks to change the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) is considered valid if the [Objector](#objecoes) believes that it meets all the 4 following criteria:  

1. **Degradation**. An [Objection](#objections) is about a harm that the [Proposal](#proposal) may cause to the [Circle](#circles).
2. **Causality**. This harm is caused by the [Proposal](#proposal), that is, it does not exist without it.
3. **Data-based**. The [Objection](#objections) is based on current data or past experiences. In other words, it is not an anticipation of future events. However, if the alleged harm is so disastrous that the [Circle](#circles) wouldn not be able to adapt in the future, this criteria can be disconsidered.
4. **Role-related**. The [Objection](#objections) affects one of the [Objector](#objections) [Roles](#roles) in the [Circle](#circles).

When validating [Objection](#objections), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with logical reasoning and are thus reasonable. Valid [Objection](#objections) must be integrated.

#### <span id="integration">4.6.5 Integration </span>

If there are [Objection](#objections), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must facilitate a process for integrating them to the [Proposal](#proposal). The goal of "Integration" is to modify the [Proposal](#proposal) so it would still solve the original [Tension](#tensions), but without causing the raised [Objection](#objections). If the [Proposal](#proposal) is modified, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must give the participants another opportunity to raise [Objections](#objections). If a [Proposal](#proposal) is taking too much time to integrate, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) can discard the [Proposal](#proposal) entirely, in order to move to the next item on the [Tension List](#tension-list).

#### <span id="meta-agreement-breach">4.6.6 Meta-Agreement Breach</span>

Any participant can raise an [Objection](#objections) of "Meta-Agreement Breach" if one considers the [Proposal](3proposal) violates one of these [Meta-Agreements](#meta-agreements). The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must then ask the [Secretary](#secretary) to interpret whether this is true or not. This special [Objection](#objections) does not need to be validated with the criteria used normaly, but it should be integrated like other ones.

#### <span id="asynchronous-proposals">4.6.7 Asynchronous Proposals</span>

Changes to the [Circle](#circles) [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) can be proposed outside [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) and are automatically approved if all [Circle Members](#circle-members) declare they do not have any [Objections](#objections). If any [Objection](#objections) is raised or a participant declares one would like to treat the [Tension](#tensions) in a conventional way, the [Proposal](#proposal) must be escalated to the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode) of a regular [Circle Meeting](#circle-meetings).

> Check the **Patterns for Adapting** in the [Pattern Library][library].

### <span id="select-mode">4.7 Select Mode</span>

The "Select Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting) whose goal is to *choose [Circle Members](#circle-members) to fill one or more of the three [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles)*. THe [Facilitator](#facilitator) must facilitate the Select Mode through a democratic election process, where the majority of votes will determine the elected [Partner](#partners).

> Check the **Patterns for Selecting** in the [Pattern Library][library].

#### <span id="select-immediately">4.7.1 Select immediately</span>

Any [Circle Member](#circle-member) may ask the [Facilitator](#facilitator) to jump to the [Select Mode](#select-mode) and perform an election for one or more of the [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles). If that is the case, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must do this immediately.

#### <span id="select-only-in-circle-meetings">4.7.2 Select only in Circle Meetings</span>

The election process of the 3 [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles) must be done only inside a [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting).

#### <span id="eligible-partners">4.7.3 Eligible Partners</span>

All and only [Circle Members](#circle-members) are eligible for the 3 [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles), with the exception of the [Partner](#partners) that fills the [Outer Link](#outer-link) [Role](#roles), who is not eligible as [Facilitator](#facilitator) or [Inner Link](#inner-link) of the same [Circle](#circles).

#### <span id="tie-breaker">4.7.4 Tie Breaker</span>

In case of tie for the election of any [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must choose one of the following criteria to untie:

- The [Partner](#partners) that nominated oneself, if only one of the tied candidates has;
- The [Partner](#partners) that is already filling the [Role](#roles), if only one of the tied candidates is;
- Randomly choosing one of the tied candidates.

### <span id="care-mode">4.8 Care Mode</span>

The "Care Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting) whose goal is to *take care of the tribal space and nurture the quality of relationships between the participants*. This [Mode](#circle-meetings) must not be used to change the [Circle](#circles) [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) or engage [Partners](#partners) in their [Roles](#roles) and [Duties](#rights-and-duties).

> Check the **Patterns fore Caring** in the [Pattern Library][library].

## <span id="essential-roles">5. Essential Roles</span>

Each [Circle](#circles) contains 4 "Essential Roles" automatically created: [Outer Link](#outer-link), [Inner Link](#inner-link), [Facilitator](#facilitator), and [Secretary](#secretary).

### <span id="elected-essential-roles">5.1 Elected Essential Roles</span>

When a [Circle](#circles) has two or more [Partners](#partners), it must elect in its [Select Mode](#select-mode) the 3 "Elected Essential Roles" of [Facilitator](#facilitator), [Secretary](#secretary), and [Inner Link](#inner-link). The only exception is the outermost [Circle](#circles) in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure), which must not elect the [Inner Link](#inner-link).

### <span id="modifying-essential-roles">5.2 Modifying Essential Roles</span>

The [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) of each [Circle](#circles) can be modified during the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode). However, the following restrictions apply:

- The name and the [Purpose](#roles) of the [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) cannot be modified;
- New [Accountabilities](#roles) and [Artifacts](#roles) cannot be added to the [Outer Link](#outer-link) [Role](#roles);
- The initial [Accountabilities](#roles) and [Artifacts](#roles) of the [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles) cannot be removed or modified;
- The [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) cannot be removed.

#### <span id="essential-role-modifications-do-not-propagate">5.2.1 Essential Role modifications do not propagate</span>

Modifying the [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) of a [Circle](#circles) applies only to the [Circle](#circles) where the modification took place. That is, it does not propagate to inner [Circles](#circles).

### <span id="outer-link-assignment">5.3 Outer Link Assignment</span>

The [Outer Link](#outer-link) is chosen by the outer [Circle](#circles) by whatever process that assigns [Partners](#partners) to [Roles](#roles) in the outer [Circle](#circles). The [Outer Link](#outer-link) of the outermost [Circle](#circles) is determined by the same process that adopted these [Meta-Agreements](#meta-agreements).

### <span id="assigning-partners-to-roles">5.4 Assigning Partners to Roles</span>

The [Outer Link](#outer-link) is accountable for assining [Partners](#partners) to the [Roles](#roles) of the [Circle](#circles) and may invite any [Partner](#partners) of the [Organization](#organization), unless a [Restriction](#restrictions) says otherwises.

### <span id="facilitator">5.5 Facilitator</span>

The [Role](#role) of the "Facilitator" has the following initial definition:

**Purpose**: _Healthy [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) aligned with the [Meta-Agreements](#meta-agreements)_

**Accountabilities**:

The [Role](#roles) of the "Outer Link" has the following initial definition:

**Purpose**: _The [Purpose](#roles) of the [Circle](#circles)_

**Accountabilities**:
- Structuring the [Circle](#circles) to express its [Purpose](#roles)
- Assigning [Partners](#partners) to the [Circle](#circles) [Roles](#roles); monitoring fit; offering feedback to enhance fit; re-assigning [Roles](#roles) to other [Partners](#partners) when needed
- Establishing priorities for the [Circle](#circles)

**Artifacts**:
- [Role](#roles) assignment within the [Circle](#circles)

The [Outer Link](#outer-link) holds all [Circle](#circles) undelegated [Accountabilities](#roles) and [Artifacts](#roles).
