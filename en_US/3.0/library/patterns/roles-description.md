# Roles Description

**Also known as**: Reverse To-Do, Description of Initial Structure

## Context

A [Circle](../../meta-agreements.md#circles) is being created and needs to describe its [Roles](../../meta-agreements.md#roles) for the first time. People are already working and meet regularly.

## Forces

There are many pitfalls at this time. For example, creating [Roles](../../meta-agreements.md#roles) too long or [Roles](../../meta-agreements.md#roles) that still do not exist. This moment is also important: if prople find this process too laborious they'll be too lazy to alter and adapt the structure.

## Problem

We need to create the initial structure in a fast, participative and elegant way. The focus must be in translating the existing work to a structure of [Roles](../../meta-agreements.md#roles).

## Solution

In a session that can take from 2 to 4 hours, we propose to the partners of the [Circle](../../meta-agreements.md#circle) that's forming the following dynamics:

**1\) Performed activities**: Each person writes in a piece of paper everything they have done in the last 30 to 60 days. It's only valid to include things that were really done, not things that should have been done but wasn't for some reason.

Examples of activities:

* a\) I wrote a post about self management practices
* b\) I wrote a post about the importance of self organization
* c\) I optimized a blog for search engines
* d\) I created a new page for the open courses from Target Teal

**2\) Translation to** [**Accountabilities**](../../meta-agreements.md#roles): Each one takes their list and makes a translation of the performed activities to [Accountabilities](../../meta-agreements.md#roles), writing a post-it for each one. The translation consists in making the activity generic and also observing good practices for accountability description.

In some cases, two or more activities can be merged into a single Accountability. All Accountabilities are put on a board. They are no more attached to a person and can float freely.

Translation examples:

* Write content for Target Teal's blog \(activities a and b\)
* Optimize the blog for search engines \(activity c\)
* Create new pages in the website when required \(activity d\)

**3\) Blocks of Accountabilities**: The group builds groups or blocks of [Accountabilities](../../meta-agreements.md#roles) that have something in common. Usually, the following criterias are used to group Accontabilities: They seem to "go together" or should always be made by the same person, they have a greater goal in common \(a [Purpose](../../meta-agreements.md#roles).\). In this phase, Accountabilities too close or duplicates are removed.

**4\) Roles**: Each block of Accountabilities can become a [Role](../../meta-agreements.md#roles). The partners should identify a name and also a [Purpose](../../meta-agreements.md#roles), considering the good practices for naming Roles and good Purposes.

**5\) Verification**: The partners can try to identify who plays each [Role](../../meta-agreements.md#roles), positioning a small post-it with the person name beside the accountability sets. After that, it's important to check if each partner plays the [Role](../../meta-agreements.md#roles) really do all the accountabilities of the Role. It's not possible to partially energize a Role. Maybe after this verification a [Role](../../meta-agreements.md#roles) can be broken into several smaller [Roles](../../meta-agreements.md#roles).

**6\) Artifacts:** Partners look for any [Artifact](../../meta-agreements.md#roles) that's exclusively controlled by some partner and need to be registered in some [Role](../../meta-agreements.md#roles). Remember that it's only valid to add Artifacts that are already controlled by someone. It's also possible to skip this step and start with no Artifacts.

That's it, the initial structure is described!

### Hints for good [Accountabilities](../../meta-agreements.md#roles)

1. The Accountability should start with a verb in the infitive form.
2. Usually, accountabilities to manage people are not considered, as the goal is to foster self management.
3. An Accountability can refer to other [Roles](../../meta-agreements.md#roles), but it's not advised to mention people.
4. Be careful with verbs the verbs __assert__, __approve_ and __collaborate__. Reasons below:

**Assert**: Usually, implies trying to control a result. We should capture how this is done, and not the final result. Examples: Instead of "To assert that the product has the best engagement possible", we can ask, how this is done? Maybe the answer is "To develop features that increase user engagement".

**Approve**: Usually, when someone uses the verb "to approve", they mean to has exclusive control of something. But in O2, an Accountability never limits another Role. Usually it makes more sense to add an Artifact of the "thing" for which an approval is required. For example: instead of an Accountability "To approve changes in the website", add the Artifact "Changes to the Website" to the Role.

**Collaborate**: In self management, everyone is free to collaborate with anyone. Usually, when we describe an Accountability starting with "Collaborate with", two things may happen:

1. We can foster the idea that if collaboration isn't explicitly declared as an Accountability, that [Partner](../../meta-agreements.md#partners) does not need to collaborate
2. When someone needs to "help" other Partner, they do not get responsible for that. It's best to energize them in the Role that "does" and make them accountable for the whole process, not only to "help".

### Hints for good names for [Roles](../../meta-agreements.md#roles)

The name must be simple and memorable. Avoid position names, like analyst, assistant, manager, director, supervisor etc. It may be ludic, but should suggest what the Role does. Examples: Instagram Master, Marketing Inbound, Content Producer. The name ends up being a reflex of the internal culture in an area or the organization.

### Hints for good [Purposes](../../meta-agreements.md#roles)

The Purpose describes what the Role seeks. Usually a an unattainable or inexhaustible goal. The qualities are important. A verb is not necessary, because the most important thing for the Purpose are the nouns and adjectives:

Examples:

* Precise and fast analysys
* Marketing campaigns that enchant users and maximize acquisition
* Customers heard and their wishes fulfilled

## Resulting context

In a small ammount of time a structure that can be used as an starting point is created. The clarity about expectations start to appear. Some personal and professional crisis can arise when some people note that until that moment they delivered value only by controlling the work of others.

## Rationale

This pattern was inspired by the work done by consultants in Holacracy.

## Known uses

Has been used in tens of organizations in Brazil.
